# Room Layout Design Model

This project generates and predicts room layouts for a given plot size and number of rooms using a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor). It creates synthetic room layout data, trains a model, and generates visualizations and JSON files for predicted layouts. The project includes scripts for data generation, preprocessing, model training, layout prediction, and visualization.

## Project Overview
The project consists of several Python scripts:
- `data_generator.py`: Generates synthetic room layout data and saves it as JSON files.
- `preprocessor.py`: Preprocesses data by scaling numerical features and encoding room types.
- `model_trainer.py`: Trains Random Forest Regressor models for room coordinates, width, and height.
- `layout_generator.py`: Generates and visualizes room layouts with overlap correction.
- `predictor.py`: Allows users to input custom plot dimensions and room types to predict layouts.
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire process (data generation, preprocessing, training, and sample layout generation).

The model predicts room positions (`x`, `y`), sizes (`width`, `height`), and ensures no overlaps in the layout. Outputs include JSON files and PNG visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `joblib`
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/room-layout-design-model.git
   cd room-layout-design-model
2. **Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can check your Python version with**
3. **Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip.**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
**Explanation**:
- Provides step-by-step instructions for cloning the repository.
- Specifies the minimum Python version (3.8+) based on typical compatibility for the libraries used.
- Lists the exact packages required (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `joblib`) as seen in the scripts.
- Mentions `requirements.txt` for convenience, though you may need to create it (see note below).
- Guides users to verify the presence of necessary files.

## Usage:
  ### Running the Main Script
  The `main.py` script generates synthetic data, trains the model, and creates a sample room layout.
  Run the script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
  ### Running the Predictor Script
  The predictor.py script allows you to generate custom room layouts based on user input.
  Runn the script:
    ```bash
    python predictor.py

## Output Files :

The project generates the following output files:

- **`synthetic_layouts/`**:
  - Contains 10,000 JSON files (`layout_0.json` to `layout_9999.json`) generated by `main.py`.
  - Each file represents a synthetic layout with plot dimensions and room details (x, y, width, height, type).
  - Example: `layout_0.json` might contain plot width, depth, and a list of rooms with their coordinates and types.

- **`sample_layout.json`**:
  - A JSON file generated by `main.py` for a sample 50x40 plot with 4 rooms (living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom).
  - Located in the project root.
  - Example content (from provided `sample_layout.json`):
    ```json
    [
      {
        "x": 13.820629782434368,
        "y": 12.442424183797973,
        "width": 17.16631881039647,
        "height": 14.158100455132951,
        "type": "living_room"
      },
      ...
    ]

## Model Details:

- **Model Type**: Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators, implemented using `scikit-learn`.
- **Features**:
  - `plot_width`: Width of the plot (20–100).
  - `plot_depth`: Depth of the plot (20–100).
  - `num_rooms`: Number of rooms (2–8).
  - `room_type_num`: Numerical encoding of room types (bedroom: 0, bathroom: 1, kitchen: 2, living_room: 3).
- **Targets**:
  - `room_x`: X-coordinate of the room’s bottom-left corner.
  - `room_y`: Y-coordinate of the room’s bottom-left corner.
  - `room_width`: Width of the room.
  - `room_height`: Height of the room.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Numerical features (`plot_width`, `plot_depth`, `num_rooms`) are scaled using `StandardScaler` from `scikit-learn`.
  - Room types are encoded as integers (0–3) using a predefined mapping.
- **Training**:
  - Trained on 10,000 synthetic layouts generated by `data_generator.py`.
  - Data is split 80/20 (training/test) using `train_test_split`.
  - Four separate models predict `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.
- **Performance** (from `report.txt`):
  - X-coordinate R² score: 0.10
  - Y-coordinate R² score: 0.08
  - Width R² score: 0.21
  - Height R² score: 0.18
- **Overlap Correction**:
  - The `layout_generator.py` and `predictor.py` scripts adjust room positions to prevent overlaps by shifting rooms right or down while ensuring they stay within plot boundaries.
